1
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:04,930
"Pilot"

2
00:00:09,726 --> 00:00:12,050
Hello? Hello?

3
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:13,460
Can you hear me?

4
00:00:13,495 --> 00:00:14,530
Oh, damn it.

5
00:00:15,874 --> 00:00:16,681
Come on!

6
00:00:16,716 --> 00:00:18,807
<i>Some people call this
the middle of nowhere...</i>

7
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:21,600
<i>You know, one of
those places you fly over</i>

8
00:00:21,601 --> 00:00:23,990
<i>on your way from somewhere
to somewhere else,</i>

9
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,633
<i>but you wouldn't live here.</i>

10
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:29,132
Folks, right now we're flyingover
the great state of Indiana,

11
00:00:29,167 --> 00:00:30,538
if you'd like
to take a look.

12
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:36,949
<i>Well, look down next time, and you'll
see us down here in the middle--</i>

13
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,886
<i>Orson, Indiana,
heart of the heartland,</i>

14
00:00:39,921 --> 00:00:42,250
<i>proud home
of Little Betty Snack Cakes,</i>

15
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:46,532
<i>the demolition derby for the homeless
and the world's largest polyurethane cow.</i>

16
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:50,026
So how'd I end up in the middle
of the road in this getup?

17
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:50,829
Here? No.

18
00:00:51,311 --> 00:00:52,455
Bars! I got bars.

19
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:55,072
<i>Guess it all started
a couple of weeks ago,</i>

20
00:00:55,214 --> 00:00:58,070
<i>and no, I'm not
an actual superhero,</i>

21
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:00,027
<i>not unless you count
getting my kids out the door</i>

22
00:01:00,062 --> 00:01:01,261
<i>for school every morning.</i>

23
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:03,120
I made breakfast!

24
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:04,968
Come on, we're late!
Let's go, let's go!

25
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,489
That's my youngest--
Brick.

26
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,610
<i>You know how you think giving a kid
a cool name will make him cool?</i>

27
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:12,546
<i>It doesn't.</i>

28
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:14,251
Okay, now listen.

29
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:16,323
Today at recess,
I don't want you

30
00:01:16,393 --> 00:01:19,447
wandering around alone
on the perimeter, all right?

31
00:01:19,482 --> 00:01:21,550
Makes you an easy target,
you know?

32
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:24,098
Like--like the gazelle that gets
separated from the pack.

33
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,138
You've gotta find yourself
a group of kids

34
00:01:26,139 --> 00:01:28,700
and just stand
near them.

35
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:32,250
You know you're my hero,
right, Mom?

36
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,022
Thank you, honey.
Eat your pancake.

37
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:35,320
It's still frozen.

38
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:37,270
Well, lick it.
It'll last longer.

39
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:39,569
Hey, Mike, have you seen
that envelope

40
00:01:39,604 --> 00:01:41,530
with my driver's license
from the DMV?

41
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,883
I need it for work.

42
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,882
Why is this place
such a mess?

43
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,702
<i>That one over there
would be Axl.</i>

44
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:51,612
<i>Since he hit 15,
he hibernates in his room</i>

45
00:01:51,629 --> 00:01:53,634
<i>and only comes out
to paw through our food</i>

46
00:01:53,635 --> 00:01:55,667
<i>and shoot off
sarcastic comments.</i>

47
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:57,986
Oh, we're
out of chips.

48
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:00,380
Nice job, Mom.

49
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:02,390
Yeah, I can't hear you
if you don't have pants on.

50
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,490
Mom, where's my homework?

51
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:06,654
Uh-huh! Okay.

52
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,180
When did this happen?

53
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:17,150
Mike, look at this.
Look at this.

54
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,675
This is--I haven't had
my driver's license picture

55
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:19,810
taken in seven years,
okay?

56
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:21,098
- Mm-hmm.
- Here's the old one.

57
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:22,956
Look at this.

58
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,100
What happened to me?

59
00:02:24,119 --> 00:02:26,991
Uh, well, back then,
you were all young and shiny

60
00:02:27,026 --> 00:02:28,698
and wondering
what your life's gonna be.

61
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,567
And now...
Well, now you know!

62
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,940
Mom!

63
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:37,920
Hey, come in here
if you want to talk to me.

64
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:39,597
Axl, put some pants on.
Here.

65
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:43,270
<i>Okay, maybe it was
just a bad picture.</i>

66
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,485
<i>I mean, yikes.</i>

67
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:50,776
Mike, does it ever bum you out that
I'm not young and shiny anymore?

68
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:52,402
Well, sure, honey.
It's a huge bummer,

69
00:02:52,466 --> 00:02:54,100
but what are you gonna do?

70
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:55,550
Oh, shoot!

71
00:02:55,585 --> 00:02:57,246
I wanted chips
for my lunch.

72
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:58,959
She didn't buy any.

73
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:02,350
Sue, grab a pancake.
We're late.

74
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:03,990
<i>That's Sue.</i>

75
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,969
<i>She's been going through
a bit of an awkward stage...</i>

76
00:03:06,396 --> 00:03:07,940
<i>for the past 13 years.</i>

77
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:10,860
Mom, the dryer ate
my leg warmers again.

78
00:03:10,895 --> 00:03:14,210
I told you, you can't put
wet things in the dryer anymore.

79
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,721
Well, I need 'em,
'cause guess what?

80
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,722
I'm trying out
for show choir this week.

81
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,173
<i>I know, I know--

82
00:03:21,233 --> 00:03:23,850
<i>That's not an expression parents
should have on their faces</i>

83
00:03:23,885 --> 00:03:26,870
<i>when their daughter tells them
she's trying out for something.</i>

84
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:30,380
<i>But see, Sue had a long history
of things she tried out for--</i>

85
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:33,718
<i>A long and...
painful history.</i>

86
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:44,676
Show choir.

87
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,754
Wow, super.

88
00:03:45,824 --> 00:03:47,900
That--that should be
fun to try out for.

89
00:03:48,753 --> 00:03:50,785
Now listen, Dad's gonna
fix the dryer again,

90
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,351
but right now, I just need
everybody to go.

91
00:03:52,386 --> 00:03:53,660
Let's get out the door.
Come on.

92
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,240
- Let's go, let's go!
- Mom.

93
00:03:55,275 --> 00:03:59,599
<i>That driver's license picture was
a big wake-up call from the DMV.</i>

94
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,830
<i>Somehow the life had been
sucked right out of me.</i>

95
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:06,970
<i>But who or what
had sucked it?</i>

96
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,110
- Mom, he's not giving my bag back!
- Mom, Mom, Mom.

97
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,272
- Mom! Mom!
- Mom.

98
00:04:12,307 --> 00:04:15,149
We did teach 'em
the word "Dad," didn't we?

99
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:19,596
<i>We're a two-job family.</i>

100
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:22,801
<i>Mike manages a bunch of
boneheads down at the quarry.</i>

101
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,339
Oh, for cryin' out loud.

102
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:31,423
And my latest job
I'm too smart for,

103
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:35,151
is selling cars at Orson's
last surviving car dealership.

104
00:04:35,152 --> 00:04:36,592
Well, well, well.

105
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,019
What a month, huh?

106
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,369
Frankie, don't let him
intimidate you.

107
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:42,952
He may be the king
of sales around here,

108
00:04:42,992 --> 00:04:45,495
but he's been rejected by
the Elks Lodge twice.

109
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:46,974
I'm not gonna say
by who.

110
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:50,295
- It was me.
- Really?

111
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:53,225
I told them that
he's a pedophile.

112
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,902
- No.
- Yeah. He's not.

113
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:57,980
He's not a pedophile.
He's not.

114
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,825
- Wait, Bob.
- What?

115
00:04:59,845 --> 00:05:01,100
Okay, this check
can't be right.

116
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:04,050
This is lower than the amount
I spent on gas to get here.

117
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,272
Ain't nothing wrong with
the check, Frances.

118
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,977
That there
is your base salary,

119
00:05:08,012 --> 00:05:10,523
and that's what it's gonna stay
until you sell a car

120
00:05:10,558 --> 00:05:11,640
and get a commission.

121
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:13,848
Now one week left
in the month.

122
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:17,143
You sell a car, or you may be
out on your keister.

123
00:05:18,688 --> 00:05:19,630
Yeah. Yeah.

124
00:05:19,665 --> 00:05:22,358
I, um...
but listen, I mean,

125
00:05:22,545 --> 00:05:26,517
my keister's having a little
cash flow problem right now.

126
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:30,460
I may not have sold a car yet,
but I've come real close.

127
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:31,759
See that buck up there?

128
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,401
He came real close
to not being hit by a bullet.

129
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,806
You see
what I'm saying?

130
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,163
By the way, did you ever
get a new driver's license?

131
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:41,444
We gotta post them,

132
00:05:41,515 --> 00:05:43,704
and that old one
didn't look a thing like you.

133
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:48,169
Oh, yeah.
Now that's you.

134
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:53,737
I see myself
as kind of a matchmaker

135
00:05:53,772 --> 00:05:54,830
for people and vehicles,

136
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,190
and I just have a feeling
about you and this little cutie.

137
00:05:58,523 --> 00:06:00,098
Why don't we take it
for a test drive and--

138
00:06:00,133 --> 00:06:02,818
<i>Frankie, you have
a call on line one.</i>

139
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,831
<i>Your son's school
is on line one.</i>

140
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,720
Hurt, or just in trouble?

141
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:08,632
'Cause if
it's just in trouble,

142
00:06:08,672 --> 00:06:10,571
can you ask him
if I call him back?

143
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:16,835
Yeah, this is Frankie Heck.
Is everything okay?

144
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,460
You said you were
gonna pick him up.

145
00:06:22,495 --> 00:06:24,052
No, you said you were.

146
00:06:24,087 --> 00:06:26,329
<i>I even put a post-it
on your thermos.</i>

147
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,630
<i>Is that
what that means?</i>

148
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:34,043
<i>There's birthday cake
in the break room.</i>

149
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:35,574
<i>It's angel food.</i>

150
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,625
Feel that?
Uh, take a left right here.

151
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:41,926
Pretty smooth, huh?

152
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,122
That's 150 horsepower.

153
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,330
And did I tell you
about our recession deals?

154
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:49,684
Oh, get in the right lane and
pull over, pull over, pull over!

155
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:52,590
Quick, quick!
Get in, get in, get in!

156
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:59,028
Brick, honey,
how do you like those seats?

157
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:00,065
They're amazing.

158
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:02,615
They also come with
optional leather trim

159
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:04,601
and preferred suede inserts.

160
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,829
And if you buy today,
I'll throw the inserts in for free.

161
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,284
Mom, are you crazy?

162
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:11,576
That's a $600 value.

163
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,950
At least
you're still my hero.

164
00:07:17,985 --> 00:07:19,300
Aww, thanks, pal.

165
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:20,738
I made dinner!

166
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:23,206
- Thank you.
- Sure.

167
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,217
Hey, Underpants, you think
you're too good for us?

168
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,203
We are a family,

169
00:07:28,238 --> 00:07:30,953
and we are going to
eat <i>together</i> as a family.

170
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:34,787
<i>This is
Dancing With the Stars.</i>

171
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:38,489
Okay, quick, let's hear
about everybody's day.

172
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:40,191
Mine sucked.
Next.

173
00:07:40,232 --> 00:07:42,129
Well, ahem,
I'm trying to decide

174
00:07:42,164 --> 00:07:44,704
what number I should do
for my show choir audition.

175
00:07:44,739 --> 00:07:46,816
- Oh, my God.
- What?

176
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,021
Does it really matter
what song you pick?

177
00:07:48,056 --> 00:07:49,541
'Cause there's no way
you're gonna make it.

178
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:50,514
- Mom!
- Mike.

179
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:51,307
Axl.

180
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,234
You know, your brother's
just trying to say

181
00:07:53,269 --> 00:07:54,961
you should just choose
whatever you want.

182
00:07:54,996 --> 00:07:58,060
Now me, I like a quick-song.
Quick, leave 'em wantin' more.

183
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,220
You have a meeting with
my teacher on Monday.

184
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:02,708
What?

185
00:08:02,738 --> 00:08:05,541
It's imperative that you
both be there, she says.

186
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,247
Imperative!

187
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:10,640
Who's he whispering to?
Why does he do that?

188
00:08:10,675 --> 00:08:12,135
I thought I told you
to knock that off.

189
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:13,798
I like it.
It soothes me.

190
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:15,062
Okay, what teacher's meeting?

191
00:08:15,102 --> 00:08:16,218
I didn't even
get a note.

192
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,840
Oh, my God,
you're so weird.

193
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,130
- Mom!
- Mike.

194
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:23,929
Axl.

195
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:27,110
Yeah, well, from what
I can tell, it is Monday.

196
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,120
Okay,
we both work Monday.

197
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:32,057
Sorry.
Sorry.

198
00:08:32,449 --> 00:08:33,671
Sorry.

199
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:39,231
Did I tell you Hank at the quarry
found his finger today?

200
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,610
Oh, really?
That's good.

201
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:42,849
Mom, Dad.

202
00:08:43,515 --> 00:08:45,984
Are you guys
disappointed in me?

203
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,614
You know,
'cause I never make anything?

204
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:50,440
Oh, sure
I'm disappointed, hon.

205
00:08:50,475 --> 00:08:52,375
This is, like, the 12th thing
you've tried out for.

206
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:54,450
I mean, I love not
having to go to the events.

207
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:59,083
I'm thinking maybe I won't
try out for show choir...

208
00:08:59,765 --> 00:09:02,000
if you guys
don't think I should.

209
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:04,350
<i>Of course she shouldn't.</i>

210
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:07,238
<i>Show choir in Indiana
has always been huge.</i>

211
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:09,970
<i>Next to basketball,
its combination of singing</i>

212
00:09:10,005 --> 00:09:12,005
<i>and Broadway-caliber
choreography</i>

213
00:09:12,236 --> 00:09:14,573
<i>is the most cutthroat
competition around.</i>

214
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,835
<i>I didn't want
to see her get hurt,</i>

215
00:09:18,244 --> 00:09:20,685
<i>but then I looked
at her young and shiny face</i>

216
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,497
<i>not beaten down yet
by busted dryers</i>

217
00:09:23,532 --> 00:09:25,725
<i>and mean bosses
with guns...</i>

218
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,460
- Go for it.
- Hmm?

219
00:09:27,935 --> 00:09:30,321
- You really--you really think so?
- <i>No.</i>

220
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,378
Dad?

221
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:39,274
This could be
your year.

222
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:41,306
Okay! Cool.

223
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:44,589
<i>We are so screwed.</i>

224
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:49,004
Brick is a very
quirky child...

225
00:09:49,433 --> 00:09:51,941
Maybe clinically quirky, even.

226
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:54,118
We have no idea
what you mean.

227
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:56,442
<i>We knew exactly
what she meant.</i>

228
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:04,820
Happy birthday to you!

229
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:07,747
Mrs. Rettig, Mrs. Rettig,
I want to tell you

230
00:10:07,782 --> 00:10:09,850
something funny
I did the other day.

231
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:11,966
Well, that may be because

232
00:10:12,001 --> 00:10:14,737
you haven't spent much time
here in the classroom.

233
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,693
Are we supposed to?

234
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,749
I mean, isn't that
the point of school--

235
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,418
That between 8:00 and 3:00,
he's your problem?

236
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,674
If he, you know, eats
his napkin at dinner,

237
00:10:22,709 --> 00:10:24,540
we don't call you and ask you
to come over to our house.

238
00:10:24,575 --> 00:10:27,781
Look, I would love to spend
more time here, but I work.

239
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:29,617
I'm at work right now.

240
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,395
Brick's a very bright boy,

241
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:38,770
but we feel he could benefit from
a series of more formal tests--

242
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:41,123
Okay, look,
Brick isn't your typical kid,

243
00:10:41,163 --> 00:10:45,260
but he is funny and sweet
and probably a genius.

244
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,500
Okay, so he doesn't fit into
your cookie-cutter mold.

245
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:49,900
But that doesn't mean
that he needs fixing.

246
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:53,910
Our oldest son had a completely
pointed head until he was six.

247
00:10:53,911 --> 00:10:55,158
Like a candy corn.

248
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:56,659
And so what,
we got some funny looks

249
00:10:56,694 --> 00:10:57,812
when we took him
to the mall?

250
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,090
You know
what we did about it?

251
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:00,237
Nothing.

252
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,510
And eventually, it just
flattened out all on its own.

253
00:11:02,511 --> 00:11:04,033
I think what we're trying
to say here is,

254
00:11:04,068 --> 00:11:05,020
thanks for your concern,

255
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:08,050
but our Brick doesn't need
any special anything.

256
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:09,610
- He's fine.
- Mm-hmm.

257
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:11,666
His best friend
is his backpack.

258
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:17,149
I just hope he's weird enough
that our insurance covers it.

259
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:22,213
How happy are you
with your car?

260
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,952
<i>First a busted dryer,
now a busted kid.</i>

261
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:29,370
<i>I needed to sell a car now
more than ever.</i>

262
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:31,418
<i>And if Ehlert caught me
sneaking in and out,</i>

263
00:11:31,419 --> 00:11:33,455
<i>he'd nail my keister
to his wall.</i>

264
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:36,890
Mr. Ehlert was looking
for you, Frankie.

265
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:37,647
Where you been?

266
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:40,053
Here.
Right here.

267
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,540
Just, uh, working
with this fine woman

268
00:11:44,575 --> 00:11:47,121
who's interested
in this fine car.

269
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:49,117
Actually, I am interested
in this car.

270
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,446
Get outta town.

271
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,668
But I was just wondering
if a convertible is too wild for me.

272
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,250
Are you kidding me?

273
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:59,463
Wild on the outside,
but dependable on the inside.

274
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,320
Yeah, you know what?

275
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:04,891
- I consider myself a matchmaker--
- <i>Frankie, call on line one.</i>

276
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:07,500
- For people and vehicles...
- <i>It's your husband.</i>

277
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:10,453
And you look like
the type of person--

278
00:12:10,488 --> 00:12:11,998
<i>He sounds pretty mad.</i>

279
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:13,735
<i>He's at Axl's school.</i>

280
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:16,604
<i>He needs you to go back
and pick up Brick.</i>

281
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,080
Oh, come on!

282
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,480
No, he is supposed
to pick up Brick!

283
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:22,533
Axl is at football
until 5:00!

284
00:12:22,568 --> 00:12:25,710
Tell him to read
his damn thermos!

285
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,820
Oh, look, look, I can always
come back another day.

286
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,940
- No!
- No, I'm a mom, too.

287
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,458
I know what it's like.

288
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:38,325
<i>All sales personnel,
the doughnuts are here.</i>

289
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:40,046
Now you're suspended
for three games?

290
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,550
What the hell is
the matter with you?

291
00:12:41,551 --> 00:12:42,122
What did he do?

292
00:12:42,172 --> 00:12:43,810
He called his football coach
a moron.

293
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,160
You always call him
a moron.

294
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:46,864
He called for a bomb
on 4th and 1.

295
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:48,691
You think you're some
sort of a big shot

296
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:49,955
just 'cause
you play ball?

297
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:52,320
Well, the smart-mouth
attitude goes today.

298
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:52,930
Whatever.

299
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:54,395
That's it!
Go to your room.

300
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,751
No, wait. You like your room.
Go to Sue's room!

301
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,405
Moron.

302
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,020
Damn it.

303
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:04,009
If only he had, like,
a car or a TV or a cell phone--

304
00:13:04,044 --> 00:13:05,580
something good we could
take away from him.

305
00:13:05,615 --> 00:13:08,519
- I know.
- Mom, you're my hero.

306
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,125
That's nice, honey,
but we're trying to think up

307
00:13:10,126 --> 00:13:11,550
a good punishment
for your brother.

308
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:13,409
You'll need a costume.

309
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:16,630
- Costume.
- Huh?

310
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:18,770
I'm doinga book report
on Superwoman.

311
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:20,848
You have to come dress
like her Monday

312
00:13:20,939 --> 00:13:23,050
so I can show and tell you
as part of my project.

313
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:25,321
You can also come
as Jungle Girl,

314
00:13:25,356 --> 00:13:26,541
but I'd have
to do it today.

315
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:30,140
Damn it, Brick, you've gotta
tell me these things earlier.

316
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,005
I did!

317
00:13:31,035 --> 00:13:33,360
I've been telling you
all week you're my hero.

318
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:35,069
Didn't you listen?

319
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,553
Whatever!

320
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:38,795
Honey, okay, listen.
I'm sorry.

321
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,090
- Honey, come back here.
- Oh, let him be.

322
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:43,990
What is happening?

323
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:47,240
I used to think I was
a pretty good mom, and now...

324
00:13:47,275 --> 00:13:48,880
God, I really--
I don't know.

325
00:13:48,915 --> 00:13:50,866
Hey, come on.
You're a great mom.

326
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,533
So Brick is weird, and
Sue has no recognizable talent,

327
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:58,734
and Axl's flushing his future
down the toilet.

328
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:00,670
- All kids are screwed up.
- Yeah,

329
00:14:00,705 --> 00:14:02,630
not the Donahues
across the street.

330
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,915
No. Those kids are awesome.

331
00:14:03,985 --> 00:14:04,929
I know.

332
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:09,071
I did it.
I made show choir!

333
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,740
- You did?
- Yeah!

334
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:12,743
You sure, honey?

335
00:14:12,778 --> 00:14:14,680
Is it actually
written down somewhere?

336
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:15,603
Yes, yes!

337
00:14:15,634 --> 00:14:17,259
And they already
rotated me in,

338
00:14:17,298 --> 00:14:19,020
so I gotta learn everything
super quick

339
00:14:19,055 --> 00:14:20,919
for our first competition
this Friday.

340
00:14:20,954 --> 00:14:22,797
Oh, my God!

341
00:14:23,502 --> 00:14:24,600
This is huge!

342
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:26,345
Oh, honey, that's great!

343
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:28,030
I'm so proud of you.

344
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:29,610
Thanks, Dad.

345
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,712
All right, well, I'd better
get my homework done,

346
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:34,396
because I am going
to be so busy.

347
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:41,082
<i>Either Sue does have
some talent,</i>

348
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:43,529
<i>or we have one
crappy show choir.</i>

349
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:45,919
<i>This called
for a celebration.</i>

350
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:48,960
Sue, I'm just
so proud of you.

351
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,098
I never thought
you'd make anything.

352
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,186
Here's a dollar.

353
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:56,754
Thank you!

354
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,220
Hey, come on,
everybody!

355
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:00,470
It's getting kind of cold.

356
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:03,434
We should all get inside
and eat together as a family.

357
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:06,260
Move that bus!

358
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:09,070
Oh, my.

359
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:12,080

364
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:54,910
- Do you see Sue?
- No.

365
00:15:54,945 --> 00:15:55,895
Where the hell is she?

366
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:03,660
She's on the crew.

367
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:04,871
What?

368
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,270
Oh, that's great!

369
00:16:06,305 --> 00:16:07,550
The only thing lamer
than show choir

370
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,236
is being on the crew
for show choir.

371
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:11,544
Where's Sue?

372
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:15,041
She's in the--the middlish row
behind the pregnant girl.

373
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:19,670
Why didn't she tell us
she was only on the crew?

374
00:16:19,705 --> 00:16:20,370
I don't know.

375
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,309
She does look
real happy, though.

376
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:35,530
That's my daughter--
That's my daughter right there.

377
00:16:35,565 --> 00:16:36,726
Go, Sue!

378
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:49,925
One more.
One more.

379
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,090
Sue, the box.

380
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:58,145
The box.

381
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:50,728
<i>No wonder my face
looks the way it does.</i>

382
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,907
<i>The Swingsation disaster
got Sue kicked off crew.</i>

383
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,860
<i>So when Brick said it was
the day of his book report...</i>

384
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,688
Today's the day
of my book report.

385
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,882
<i>I was at the end of my rope.
But what could I do?</i>

386
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:08,049
<i>I was the no-show mom whose kid's
best friend was his backpack.</i>

387
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,331
<i>I put on
my spanx and went.</i>

388
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,550
Anybody call for Superwoman?

389
00:18:25,591 --> 00:18:27,643
That's next Monday.

390
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:31,667
Okay, okay, come on.
Back to the story.

391
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:38,592
Hi, Bob.

392
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,567
Frankie.
Yeah, it's me, Bob.

393
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:42,498
<i>Listen, that Gail woman--
She came back</i>

394
00:18:42,533 --> 00:18:43,484
to purchase a car.

395
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:44,928
She's looking for you.

396
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:46,064
<i>But that dummy Pete--</i>

397
00:18:46,113 --> 00:18:47,083
He's moving in
for the kill.

398
00:18:47,123 --> 00:18:48,552
He's plying her
with snow cones.

399
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:49,750
<i>I don't think she can
hold out much longer.</i>

400
00:18:49,785 --> 00:18:50,894
She's on her second grape.

401
00:18:50,895 --> 00:18:52,890
No, no!
That is my customer!

402
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:55,784
Listen, don't let her move.
I'm gonna be right there, okay?

403
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:01,324
Damn it.

404
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,460
And the braking system
is just, like, so great.

405
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:07,711
Because it, you know,
like, it stops really well,

406
00:19:07,712 --> 00:19:12,696
and it's got this, I mean,
integrated steering wheel that--

407
00:19:12,731 --> 00:19:14,803
that, like, you know,
you turn it,

408
00:19:14,896 --> 00:19:17,060
and--and honk if
people get in the way,

409
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,656
- and it just--
- Frankie, are you okay?

410
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,760
You seem
a little... stressed.

411
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,832
Oh, no. I'm fine.
I'm perfect.

412
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,633
Uh, where was I?

413
00:19:24,683 --> 00:19:27,850
Oh, the horn!
You're going to <i>love</i> the horn.

414
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:28,753
Listen to this.

415
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:33,400
Isn't that great?
I am a matchmaker.

416
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:36,400
Did I mention that?
For people and, um, wait.

417
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,210
See? Isn't that fabulous?

418
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,201
You know,
I'm a mom, too.

419
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:44,291
I know what it's like
to balance work and kids.

420
00:19:44,432 --> 00:19:45,491
I've got three.

421
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:48,741
I've got three, too.

422
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,239
Isn't it hard?

423
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,309
It's really hard.

424
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:59,569
I'm just stretched so thin.
I feel like I can't do anything right.

425
00:19:59,604 --> 00:20:00,421
Oh, I know.

426
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,631
Some days, I swear I just feel
like getting in the car

427
00:20:03,783 --> 00:20:06,070
- and driving and driving...
- Yeah.

428
00:20:06,105 --> 00:20:07,773
And never coming back.

429
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:09,649
Do you ever feel like that?

430
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,680
Only every day!

431
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,260
We made it! Yeah!

432
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:24,650
Pedal to the metal,
baby, all the way!

433
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:29,909
What was that?

434
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:31,925
What was what?

435
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,952
I think
we hit something.

436
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,520
Is something wrong
with the car?

437
00:20:35,555 --> 00:20:36,794
Maybe you'd better check.

438
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,513
No, I'm sure it's fine.

439
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:41,350
I--no--yeah, no, no.
I'll check. Okay. Okay.

440
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:45,110
Yeah, I don't see anything.

441
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,192
Hey!

442
00:20:48,227 --> 00:20:51,455
Sorry! I got
three kids in jail!

443
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:52,940
What?
No, wait!

444
00:20:52,975 --> 00:20:55,077
You're not gonna
get away with this!

445
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:58,018
I've got your license
back at the office!

446
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:02,600
Oh, I bet that's not even
her real license.

447
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:06,433
Yeah, the picture
was too good.

448
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:40,067
Somebody call
for a ride?

449
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:43,341
Rough day?

450
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,893
<i>That's the thing

00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,873
<i>But every now and then,
they save you.</i>

455
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,726
Not pretty fast
for a superhero.

456
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:17,248
- Are you okay?
- Wow! Nice tights.

457
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,905
Look at you.
Look at your mom.

458
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:20,265
Mom...

459
00:22:20,667 --> 00:22:22,401
Here with your dinner.
We made it.

460
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,064
You make it
just like I do.

461
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:33,534
I love you, guys,
you know.

462
00:22:33,569 --> 00:22:34,508
We know, Mom.

463
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:40,730
Hi. How come you never tell me
you love me?

464
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:42,627
I told you I loved you
the day I married you.

465
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:45,084
If anything had changed,
I'd let you know.

466
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:49,879
<i>So, yeah...
Back then on the old license,</i>

467
00:22:49,948 --> 00:22:52,029
